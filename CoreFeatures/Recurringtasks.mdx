Transform one-time tasks into repeating habits. Whether it's a daily standup, weekly review, or monthly bill payment, set it once and MySamantha handles the rest.

## What are Recurring Tasks?

Many tasks repeat regularly - paying bills every month, weekly team meetings, daily exercise, or yearly tax filing. Instead of creating the same task over and over, you can set up a recurring task that automatically creates the next occurrence when you complete it.

## How to create recurring tasks

### Method 1: Using the Scheduler (Recommended)

1. Create or open a task
2. Click on the Date field
3. Click on "Repeat."
4. Choose from suggested patterns or select "Custom" for more options
5. Save your task

### Method 2: Natural Language (Quick Entry)

When creating a task, simply type the recurrence pattern in the task name:

- "Team meeting every Monday."
- "Pay rent every 1st."
- "Gym every weekday."

Mysamantha will automatically recognize and set up the recurrence.

## UNDERSTANDING "EVERY" VS "EVERY!"

There are two ways recurring tasks can repeat:

### EVERY (From Original Date)

When you complete a task with "every 3 months", it reschedules based on the original date.

**Example:** Task created January 10 repeats on April 10, July 10, October 10 - regardless of when you complete it.

**Use this for:** Bills, subscriptions, appointments with fixed dates

### EVERY! (From Completion Date)

When you complete a task with "every! 3 months", it reschedules 3 months from when you completed it.

**Example:** Task completed on January 20 reschedules to April 20.

**Use this for:** Maintenance tasks, health checkups, flexible recurring activities

**Examples**:

every! 3 days - Next occurrence is 3 days after completion

every! 2 weeks - Next occurrence is 2 weeks after completion

every! 6 months - Next occurrence is 6 months after completion

## What doesn't work:

Some complex patterns aren't supported. Here are common ones and their workarounds:

**Different times for different days:**

NOT SUPPORTED: Every Monday at 8 PM and Tuesday at 9 PM

WORKAROUND: Create two separate tasks

**Complex monthly patterns:**

NOT SUPPORTED: Every 3 months on the first Friday

WORKAROUND: Manually specify the months: Every first Friday of January, April, July, October

**Excluding specific days:**

NOT SUPPORTED: Every day except weekends

WORKAROUND: Use "Every weekday" instead

**Multiple recurrence rules in one task:**

NOT SUPPORTED: Every Monday and every 1st of the month

WORKAROUND: Create two separate recurring tasks

## **Managing Recurring Tasks**

**Completing a Recurring Task**

When you complete a recurring task, it automatically schedules the next occurrence based on your recurrence pattern. The current instance is marked complete, and a new instance appears for the next date.

**Skipping an Occurrence**

If you need to skip one occurrence without affecting future ones, simply reschedule that specific instance to the next occurrence date.

**Editing a Recurring Task**

When you edit a recurring task, changes apply to all future occurrences. The recurrence pattern recalculates from today if you change the frequency or interval.

**Deleting a Recurring Task**

Deleting a recurring task removes all future occurrences. If you only want to delete one occurrence, complete it instead or convert it to a one-time task first.

## **Tips :**

**1. Be Specific with Times**

Instead of "Every day", use "Every day at 9 AM" to build consistent habits

**2. Use Weekdays for Work Tasks**

"Every weekday" is better than "Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."

**3. Combine with Deadlines**

For recurring tasks with deadlines, add the deadline in the task description

**4. Review Regularly**

Check your recurring tasks monthly to remove ones you no longer need

**5. Start Simple**

Begin with basic patterns like "Every Monday" before trying complex patterns

**6. Use First/Last for Bills**

For monthly bills, use "Every last day" or "Every 1st" for consistent scheduling
